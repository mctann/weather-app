# Weather App

This is a simple weather app built using Tailwind and React. It displays weather data for a given location, using the [WeatherAPI](https://www.weatherapi.com/) API to retrieve current weather conditions, and the [OpenAI](https://openai.com/) image generation API to generate a dynamic weather-related image.

### Getting started

    * Clone this repository: git clone https://github.com/mctann/weather-app.git
    * Install the dependencies: npm install
    * Set your Weather API key: Create .env and replace REACT_APP_WEATHER_API_KEY with your own key from Weather API.
    * Start the development server: npm start
    * Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to see the app in action.
